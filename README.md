# Module 2 | Advanced CSS Challenge | Professional Portfolio

## Finished Product

### [ðŸ”—Project Link](https://tylerfruik.github.io/Portfolio/)
This project involved creating a website completely from scratch. It principally focused on the intricacies of flex-boxes, semantic flow, link incorporation, and spacial consistency with resizes.
The resulting website from this week's project will serve as a professional portfolio comprised of all of this course's projects.
As each week will likely cover new material to be added, the content of the webpage will be ever-evolving.  Now that the entirety of the functionality is incorporated within the page, each week's addition will simply be a minute entry to the code.

This repository contains the HTML and CSS file as well as all necessary images in the /assets/ folder.

All code written manually by Tyler Fruik

### The following is an image of the final webpage:

## Assignment Information

### User Story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications

## Bugs to still be squashed:
- Project title cards change color independently of the image and border of their respective image.
- Resume, phone number, and email do not have an external link.
- Resizing to a smaller screen greatly disrupts the page's visibility
- Each project image is intended to be a .gif whose animation is triggered after the filters fade. This will be added after more projects are included.
